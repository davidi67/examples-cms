Examples of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Objects

This contains the PEM-encoded versions of the example files used in draft-ireland-examples-cms, along with the
original binary file (.p7m).

It also contains the PEM encoded private keys (.p8.pem) and equivalent certificates (.crt) used to create the examples.
These are copied for convenience from [RFC9216](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9216).
