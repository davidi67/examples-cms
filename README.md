Examples of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Objects

This contains the PEM-encoded versions of the example files used in draft-ireland-examples-cms, along with the
original binary files (.p7m).

It also contains the PEM-encoded X.509 certificates (.crt) and corresponding private keys (.p8.pem) used to create the examples.
These are copied here for convenience from [RFC9216](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9216).
